# This version of NEI loads recipes in parallel. Some recipe handlers have not been designed with that in mind and might
# crash. List these handlers in this file to force them to be loaded single threaded. Each line in this file should
# either be a comment (line starts with '#'), or a fully-qualified class name (that includes the package name) for a
# recipe handler.
# If you delete this file, it will be regenerated with the default serial handlers list.
